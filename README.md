# Windows11DragToDesktop
Restores the "Drag file to desktop"/"Drag to right corner to minimize to desktop" functionality the old taskbar had.
# How does this work?
It keeps checking the position of your cursor, if your cursor is in the bottom right corner for 1 second, and your left click button is held (dragging something), everything will minimize, showing the desktop.
